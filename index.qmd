About this blog

I am a Master of Biostatistics student at the University of Toronto with a strong background in Mathematics from the University of Waterloo. My expertise lies in statistical modelling, data science, and programming in R, Python, SAS, SQL, VBA, C, and Power BI. Through internships and academic training, I have developed advanced forecasting models and applied techniques like logistic regression, survival analysis, and machine learning to support data-driven decision-making. I am passionate about using these skills to drive meaningful insights into public health.
